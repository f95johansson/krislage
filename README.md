Nature catastrophe handling concept  
This is a project for the 24 hour hackaton by Uniaden, 2015.

In short the idea is a system for both crowdsourced information from people about a crisis and also official statments. The project exist of an working server, website and an android application which currently can send photos between each other (a report of a crisis).

As this is an awesome idea and implementation, this actually **won the hackaton!**.
